# Connect 4
Basic connect 4 game written as an excecise to learn the curses library and write something fun with my son. To run, do:
```
./connect4.py
```

I'm sure there are bugs in this. For example, in python3 the colors of the pieces don't render properly and in python2 the size is off when they're being dropped. Patches welcome!
